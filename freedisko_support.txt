[17:38] <dsdickinson> got a staff question here
[17:38] <DonHo> yes
[17:39] <@hinojosa> dsdickinson: Go ahead
[17:39] <dsdickinson> just registered a project (FreeDiskO) and set everything up for it
[17:39] <@hinojosa> DonHo: We changed our process and we really don't have options here
[17:39] <dsdickinson> but when I search for it using the search box, it doesnt come up as expected
[17:40] <DonHo> hinojosa: yes, fair enough for me
[17:40] <@hinojosa> dsdickinson: what is the project name
[17:40] <dsdickinson> FreeDiskO
[17:40] <@hinojosa> dsdickinson: and what are you using to search?
[17:40] <DonHo> thank you for your answer hinojosa
[17:40] <dsdickinson> it say "Exact matches found: FreeDiskO" but then also "No results were found to match your current search criteria."
[17:40] <@hinojosa> DonHo: You're welcome
[17:40] <@hinojosa> dsdickinson: https://sourceforge.net/search/?type_of_search=soft&words=FreeDiskO&search=Search
[17:40] <@hinojosa> right?
[17:40] <@hinojosa> how long ago did you register?
[17:41] <dsdickinson> yes
[17:41] <dsdickinson> about 30 mins ago
[17:41] <@hinojosa> dsdickinson: I've seen this before
[17:41] <@hinojosa> to be clear, the team is working on a replacement for this search system
[17:41] <dsdickinson> yeah, seems odd
[17:42] <@hinojosa> it's been a bit of a challenge the way it is now
[17:42] <@hinojosa> the team is working on a whole new infrastructure for this
[17:42] <@hinojosa> I don't have an ETA on when this will be completed as yet, however, I am aware that the work is currently active.
[17:43] <@hinojosa> with that, the current system in general works. Give it a bit more time
[17:43] <@hinojosa> as well, add more detail in your public description
[17:43] <dsdickinson> okay, wanted to make sure people could find it
[17:43] <@hinojosa> I tend to have folks search on RSS and see what the top projects that return there have
[17:44] <@hinojosa> by way of exampel - so that folks can leverage that sort of keyword model as they see fit with their projects in the current model
[17:44] == tgunr [n=tgunr@cust-66-249-166-12.static.o1.com] has joined #sourceforge
[17:44] <dsdickinson> makes sense
[17:45] <dsdickinson> thanks for the help hinojosa
[17:45] <@hinojosa> dsdickinson: You're welcome
